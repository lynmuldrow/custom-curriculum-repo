# Active Record Associations Practice

Today we're going to put what we learned about ActiveRecord into action by creating associations and implementing ActiveRecord in a Ruby program. 

## SWBATs

Today, we'll review: 
- [ ] ActiveRecord
- [ ] Models
- [ ] Migrations
- [ ] Schema
- [ ] Associations: `belongs_to`, `has_many`
- [ ] Methods

## Deliverables 

1. Using the domain of `subways`, `rides`, and `passengers`, create a program that allows us to: 

- see all passengers with details about them and the rides they take
- see all subway lines with information about how they run and who takes that line
- assign rides to passengers and subways and see info about the rides


## Steps to implementing Active Record
0. draw out schema/confirm relationship between models
1. create model
2. create migration
3. run migration
4. check your schema
5. test!
