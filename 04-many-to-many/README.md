# Ruby Many-to-Many Relationships
Yesterday we talked about how data can work together to form and express relationships. Today we'll explore a different type of relationship- many-to-many.

## SWBATs
- Implement both sides of a many to many relationship
- Practice keeping groups of data related to classes on the class as a class variable
- Demonstrate single source of truth by not storing collections of objects on other objects
- Demonstrate single source of truth by not storing one object in multiple collections


## Digging into Many-to-Many Relationships
A many-to-many relationship describes a relationship between two models where one model `has many` of the other, and vice versa.


### What are some examples of many-to-many relationships? 
- Students and Teachers
- Recipes and Ingredients
- Products and Stores
- Planes and Airports
- websites and users 
- trains and stations

### Which relationship will we select to build out? 

=> Recipes and Ingredients


*Check out our code to see how we have built this many-to-many relationship.*


### AFTER LECTURE ADDITIONS

We built a many-to-many relationship together using the following process: 

- Identify the domain problem and real-life application 
- Draw out a schema (more on this word later) to represent your models
- Create your models with the attributes and data needed to have basic functionality
- TEST and get errors
- Let errors inform you of what logic needs to be added next
- Pseudocode out your logic (we did that with comments and what we expected to happen when we added code)
- TEST out what you think will work, get errors and edit code
- Refactor and make your code efficient


This codebase has been updated with the correct solution, for reference. When watching the video lecture, use this solution to think through the logic.

Here are your test cases (run `ruby run.rb` and test these in the console): 

See if seed data is present: 
- Recipe.all
- Ingredient.all
- RecipeIngredient.all

Create new instances: 
- r = Recipe.all[1]
- i = Ingredient.all[3]

See if many-to-many relationship is valid: 
- r.ingredients
- i.recipes
- r.recipe_ingredients
- i.recipe_ingredients
